# Demon
Build Kali Linux Docker image with kali-last-snapshot repository and kali-linux-large metapackage.

## Steps:
1. `git clone https://github.com/thirdbyte/demon-docker`
2. `cd demon-docker`
3. `chmod +x *`
4. `./build`
5. `./run`

You can run applications with GUI (Linux host only) and save important files in the `/data` directory which will persist on exiting conatiner.

That's it~
